# FlapBird - Mario Edition

FlapBird is a simple and fun game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird, but with a twist! Instead of a bird, you control Mario as he navigates through obstacles. The objective is to keep Mario in the air by tapping the spacebar to make him jump and avoid hitting the pipes.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `src/index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the game environment.
- `src/style.css`: Contains styles for the game, including layout and visual elements.
- `src/game.js`: The main game logic, handling user input, game state updates, and rendering.
- `src/assets/mario.png`: The image asset used for the Mario character.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `src/index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Press the spacebar to make Mario jump and navigate through the obstacles.

## Game Mechanics

- **Jumping**: Press the spacebar to make Mario jump. The longer you hold the spacebar, the higher he will jump.
- **Obstacles**: Avoid the pipes that appear on the screen. If Mario hits a pipe, the game is over.
- **Scoring**: Each time Mario successfully passes through a pair of pipes, you earn a point.
